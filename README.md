- 👋 Hello, I’m @Charlie8rown or charles
- 👀 I enjoy exploring and riding my fixed gear bicycle.
- 🌱 I’m currently attending a bootcamp. Right now I am learning JS, CSS, HTML, and Python. 
     There are a few other things but this is what I am currently working on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can put what I know to work.
- 📫 Feel free to message me, I am pretty active here.
